I contributed to a financial planning website that is soon to be launched and used by tens of thousands of advisors and financial planners across the country.
  
  As a full stack developer, I worked on both the backend and frontend. Backend-wise, I have, inter alia, created some endpoints, modified the configuration of the application, written some unit tests and refactored classes and methods. The backend was coded in Spring Boot. As for the frontend, I created new components and pages, implemented API calls, written unit and snapshot tests, worked closely with the design team to make the website comply with their schema, and resolved a good number of bugs. The frontend was coded in React.
  
  All throughout the internship, I used the Atlassian suite tools (Jira, Confluence, BitBucket), git, Jenkins and Microsoft Teams.

I am in charge of grading students' course-long projects in ECSE 321 - Introduction to Software Engineering. The project uses gradle, Spring Boot, heroku, SQL, Travis CI and a frontend framework of the students' choosing. I am also a mentor for that class, so I help students design their architecture and debug their problems when needed.

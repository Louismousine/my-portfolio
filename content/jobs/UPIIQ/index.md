As part of a team of two interns, I built from the ground up a music streaming website that allows multiple users to add songs to a shared queue.

I coded the backend in Spring Boot. On top of the necessary endpoints, I added 2FA and email verification to the project. The frontend was made with Angular.

I also contributed to the development of a skills cloud website in Angular and wrote tests for it using Jasmine.
